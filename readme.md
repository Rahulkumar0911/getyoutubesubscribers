# Subscribers MongoDB Node Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate project for building a Node.js web application with MongoDB for managing subscribers. It provides basic API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting subscriber records.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or above)
- MongoDB (running locally or hosted)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/subscribers-mongo-node-boilerplate.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   ```bash
   cd subscribers-mongo-node-boilerplate
3. Install the dependencies:
     
     ```bash
     npm install
4.  Update the MongoDB connection URL in index.js file:

    ```javascript
    const DATABASE_URL = "mongodb://localhost/subscribers";
5. Start the application:
     
     ```bash
     node index.js
6. The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.
